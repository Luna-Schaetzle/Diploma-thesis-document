\section{Key Findings}

The research indicates that AI technologies possess the potential to fundamentally transform both industrial and educational settings by providing innovative solutions 
to complex challenges. The following section summarizes the principal findings of this study:

\paragraph{AI in Education}

In academic institutions such as schools and universities, AI can significantly enhance the learning experience by offering personalized educational resources, 
automating grading processes, and supporting intelligent tutoring systems. However, the implementation of AI in educational settings is often challenged by a shortage of 
specialized expertise, high implementation costs, and ethical concerns regarding data privacy and security. Nonetheless, 
the substantial benefits offered by AI necessitate that educational institutions actively explore and adopt these technologies 
to improve learning outcomes and better prepare students for future challenges. Moreover, given the wide range of available AI applications—ranging from chatbots and image 
recognition to natural language processing (NLP) models—it is imperative to select and integrate the most appropriate models for specific educational tasks.

\paragraph{Different LLM Models for Different Purposes}

For the AI Hub and the Code Extension, the research team conducted an extensive evaluation of available AI models to identify the most appropriate options for various tasks, including chatbots, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). The challenges associated with implementing the optimal AI models for specific tasks are substantial, due to the inherent complexity of these technologies, the limited availability of specialized expertise, and the considerable costs related to their development and deployment. Consequently, identifying suitable AI models necessitates thorough research and systematic evaluation to select those that best meet the project’s requirements. Although this process is both time- and resource-intensive, it is essential for ensuring the project’s overall success.

\paragraph{Flask Server for API}

The research team established an API server to host and execute the AI models, leveraging the Flask framework a lightweight and efficient web framework for Python. This Flask server provides a RESTful API that facilitates client interaction with the hosted AI models by handling model loading, input data processing, and the delivery of output predictions. As a critical component of both the AI Hub and the Code Extension, the server enables the seamless integration of AI functionalities into these applications. By centralizing the hosting of the models, the team ensures that they remain easily accessible, as well as readily updatable and maintainable. Flask’s versatility and extensive feature set further underscore its suitability for developing robust APIs, offering straightforward route definition, request handling, and response generation.

\paragraph{Web Application for User Interface}

The frontend of the AI Hub and the Code Extension was developed using the Vue framework, a progressive JavaScript framework recognized for its ease of use and flexibility. The development team’s prior experience with Vue enabled the rapid creation of frontend components, which are essential for building interactive and responsive user interfaces. Vue’s comprehensive suite of features and tools facilitated the integration of various components—including chatbots, image recognition tools, and NLP models—into the applications. This robust and versatile framework is particularly well-suited for modern web application development, as it supports the creation of engaging, intuitive, and dynamic user interfaces.

\section{Working in a Team}

The project team comprised three members, each assigned distinct roles and responsibilities to ensure the successful execution of the project. Collaborative work in a team setting is both challenging and rewarding, demanding effective communication, coordination, and mutual support. The following sections delineate the critical aspects of teamwork that significantly contributed to the project’s success:

\paragraph{Team Leadership and Project Management}  
Luna Schaetzle assumed the roles of team leader, project manager, and project lead, overseeing the planning, coordination, and monitoring of all project activities. Her leadership acumen, organizational skills, and strategic vision were pivotal in guiding the team through each project phase, ensuring that tasks were completed within the stipulated timeframes and budgets. Her proactive approach to problem-solving, clear communication, and commitment to fostering team cohesion were essential in cultivating a positive and collaborative work environment.

\paragraph{Documentation and Repository Management}  
In addition to her leadership responsibilities, Luna was charged with maintaining comprehensive project documentation and managing the GitHub repository. Her meticulous attention to detail and structured approach to documentation, coupled with her proficiency in version control systems, were instrumental in preserving accurate records of the project’s progress, results, and deliverables. This rigorous documentation process not only facilitated effective knowledge sharing but also promoted transparency and ensured that all project-related information was readily accessible to team members.

\paragraph{Backend Development}  
Florian Prandstetter led the development of the server and backend infrastructure for both the AI Hub and the Code Extension. His technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and extensive software development experience were crucial in designing and implementing a robust backend architecture. This included the integration of AI models and the optimization of server performance. Florian’s ability to work independently, his commitment to quality assurance, and his dedication to continuous improvement were key to delivering a backend system that met the rigorous requirements of the project.

\paragraph{Website Development}  
Luna also directed the design and implementation of the AI Hub’s website. Her creative vision, user-centric design approach, and proficiency in web development technologies were vital in creating an engaging and intuitive user interface. Her emphasis on user experience, coupled with a strong commitment to accessibility and usability standards, ensured that the website effectively addressed the needs of its target audience.

\paragraph{Raspberry Pi Development}  
Gabriel Mrkonja spearheaded the development of an AI-driven service on an edge device (Raspberry Pi) to explore the potential of AI in resource-constrained industrial environments.
