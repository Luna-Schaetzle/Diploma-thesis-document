\section{Key Findings}

The research indicates that AI technologies possess the potential to fundamentally transform both industrial and educational settings by providing innovative solutions 
to complex challenges. The following section summarizes the principal findings of this study:

\paragraph{AI in Education}

In academic institutions such as schools and universities, AI can significantly enhance the learning experience by offering personalized educational resources, 
automating grading processes, and supporting intelligent tutoring systems. However, the implementation of AI in educational settings is often challenged by a shortage of 
specialized expertise, high implementation costs, and ethical concerns regarding data privacy and security. Nonetheless, 
the substantial benefits offered by AI necessitate that educational institutions actively explore and adopt these technologies 
to improve learning outcomes and better prepare students for future challenges. Moreover, given the wide range of available AI applications—ranging from chatbots and image 
recognition to natural language processing (NLP) models—it is imperative to select and integrate the most appropriate models for specific educational tasks.

\paragraph{Server and operating systems}

Building and Maintaining the Server Environment turned out to be more challenging then orginally anticipated. The team had to deal with various issues, such as compatibility problems and performance bottlenecks.
After hard work the Team was able to establish a stable and efficient server environment, which was crucial for the successful deployment of the AI models and the overall functionality of the AI Hub and the Code Extension.

\paragraph{Different LLM Models for Different Purposes}

For the AI Hub and the Code Extension, the research team conducted an extensive evaluation of available AI models to identify the most appropriate options for various tasks, including chatbots, image recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). The challenges associated with implementing the optimal AI models for specific tasks are substantial, due to the inherent complexity of these technologies, the limited availability of specialized expertise, and the considerable costs related to their development and deployment. Consequently, identifying suitable AI models necessitates thorough research and systematic evaluation to select those that best meet the project’s requirements. Although this process is both time- and resource-intensive, it is essential for ensuring the project’s overall success.

\paragraph{Flask Server for API}

The research team established an API server to host and execute the AI models, leveraging the Flask framework a lightweight and efficient web framework for Python. This Flask server provides a RESTful API that facilitates client interaction with the hosted AI models by handling model loading, input data processing, and the delivery of output predictions. As a critical component of both the AI Hub and the Code Extension, the server enables the seamless integration of AI functionalities into these applications. By centralizing the hosting of the models, the team ensures that they remain easily accessible, as well as readily updatable and maintainable. Flask’s versatility and extensive feature set further underscore its suitability for developing robust APIs, offering straightforward route definition, request handling, and response generation.

\paragraph{Web Application for User Interface}

The frontend of the AI Hub and the Code Extension was developed using the Vue framework, a progressive JavaScript framework recognized for its ease of use and flexibility. The development team’s prior experience with Vue enabled the rapid creation of frontend components, which are essential for building interactive and responsive user interfaces. Vue’s comprehensive suite of features and tools facilitated the integration of various components—including chatbots, image recognition tools, and NLP models—into the applications. This robust and versatile framework is particularly well-suited for modern web application development, as it supports the creation of engaging, intuitive, and dynamic user interfaces.

\paragraph{Working with Visual Studio Code}

The main IDE used by the team to develope the application was Visual Studio Code. This IDE offers a wide range of features and extensions that enhance the development process, including code completion, debugging tools, and version control integration.
Working with VS Code can sometimes be challenging due to its complexity and the need to configure various settings and extensions. However, the benefits of using this powerful IDE—such as its extensive customization options, rich ecosystem of extensions, and seamless integration with other tools—far outweigh the challenges.

\section{Working in a Team}

The project team comprised three members, each assigned distinct roles and responsibilities to ensure the successful execution of the project. Collaborative work in a team setting is both challenging and rewarding, demanding effective communication, coordination, and mutual support.
