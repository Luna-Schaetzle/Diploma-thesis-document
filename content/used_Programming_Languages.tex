\subsection{Transformers}

The \texttt{Transformers} library, developed by Hugging Face, is an open-source Python package that provides implementations of state-of-the-art transformer models. 
It supports multiple deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, facilitating seamless integration across various platforms. 
The library offers access to a vast array of pre-trained models tailored for tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, 
and audio analysis. Utilizing these pre-trained models enables researchers and practitioners to achieve high performance in tasks like text classification, 
named entity recognition, and question answering without the necessity of training models from scratch, thereby conserving computational resources and time 
\cite{wolf-etal-2020-transformers}.

\subsection{JSON}

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and straightforward for machines to parse and generate. In Python, the built-in \texttt{json} module provides functionalities to serialize Python objects into JSON-formatted strings and deserialize JSON strings back into Python objects. This module supports the conversion of fundamental Python data types, such as dictionaries, lists, strings, integers, and floats, into their corresponding JSON representations. The \texttt{json} module is indispensable for tasks involving data exchange between Python applications and external systems, particularly in web development contexts where JSON is a prevalent format for client-server communication

\section{HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Combination with Vue.js}

In this project, the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used in conjunction with Vue.js to create an interactive and dynamic user experience. For more information about Vue.js, see Chapter \ref{chap:used_technologies}, Section "Vue.js."

\subsection{HyperText Markup Language (HTML)}

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the web. It serves as the backbone of web pages by organizing content through elements represented by tags. Key features of HTML include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Structure Definition:} Tags such as \texttt{<html>}, \texttt{<head>}, and \texttt{<body>} define the structural hierarchy of a web page.
    \item \textbf{Content Organization:} Elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables provide a clear and user-friendly layout.
    \item \textbf{Web Compatibility:} HTML is universally supported, ensuring seamless integration across browsers and devices.
\end{itemize}

As one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside CSS and JavaScript, HTML enables the creation of interactive and visually appealing websites. Its simplicity and adaptability make it an essential tool for web development.

\subsection{Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)}

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language designed to control the visual presentation of web pages. CSS enhances the user experience by allowing developers to define the look and feel of a website. Key functionalities of CSS include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Customization:} Control over layout, colors, fonts, and spacing for a cohesive visual identity.
    \item \textbf{Responsive Design:} Ensures consistent and optimized appearance across different devices and screen sizes.
    \item \textbf{Cascading Rules:} Allows styles to be applied at element, class, or global levels, offering flexibility in design.
\end{itemize}

As a foundational technology of the web, CSS plays a vital role in creating modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing websites.

\subsection{JavaScript}

JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS to create rich and engaging user experiences. Key features of JavaScript include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Content:} Enables animations, form validation, and real-time updates.
    \item \textbf{Client and Server-Side Usage:} Runs in web browsers via JavaScript engines and supports server-side applications through platforms like Node.js.
    \item \textbf{Extensive Ecosystem:} Offers libraries, frameworks, and tools for building feature-rich web applications.
\end{itemize}

JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility and versatility have established it as a cornerstone of web development, making it essential for developing interactive and responsive applications.
