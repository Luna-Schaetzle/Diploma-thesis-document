\subsection{Implementation of Firebase Authentication}

A robust implementation of Firebase Authentication within Vue.js involves both proper configuration and thoughtful component design. The following code snippets illustrate key aspects of this integration.

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Firebase Initialization and Authentication Setup:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption={Initializing Firebase and setting up authentication}]
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

// Firebase configuration object containing keys and identifiers
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

// Initialize Firebase with the configuration
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

// Export the authentication module for use in Vue components
export const auth = firebase.auth();

// Monitor authentication state changes
auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in; update application state accordingly
    console.log('User signed in:', user);
  } else {
    // User is signed out; update the UI to reflect sign-out state
    console.log('No user is signed in.');
  }
});
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Firebase Import and Configuration:} The Firebase modules are imported, and the application is initialized using a configuration object that contains the necessary API keys and identifiers. This setup establishes the connection to Firebase services.
    \item \textbf{Authentication Monitoring:} The \texttt{onAuthStateChanged} listener is used to monitor changes in the user’s authentication state. This enables the application to dynamically update its interface in response to sign-in or sign-out events.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Vue.js Component Example with Authentication:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML, caption={Vue.js component for user sign-in}]
<template>
    <div>
        <!-- Display a welcome message if the user is signed in -->
        <h2 v-if="user">Welcome, {{ user.email }}</h2>
        <!-- Otherwise, show the sign-in form -->
        <div v-else>
            <input v-model="email" placeholder="Email" />
            <input v-model="password" type="password" placeholder="Password" />
            <button @click="signIn">Sign In</button>
            <button @click="signInWithGoogle">Sign In with Google</button>
            <p v-if="errorMessage" class="error">{{ errorMessage }}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>

<script>
import { auth } from '@/firebase'; // Adjust the path according to your project structure
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

export default {
    data() {
        return {
            email: '',
            password: '',
            user: null,
            errorMessage: ''
        };
    },
    created() {
        // Listen for authentication state changes and update the component state
        auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
            this.user = user;
        });
    },
    methods: {
        signIn() {
            // Attempt to sign in using the provided email and password
            auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(this.email, this.password)
                .then(credential => {
                    this.user = credential.user;
                    this.errorMessage = '';
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    // Handle authentication errors by updating the errorMessage state
                    this.errorMessage = error.message;
                    console.error("Authentication error:", error);
                });
        },
        signInWithGoogle() {
            const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
            auth.signInWithPopup(provider)
                .then(result => {
                    this.user = result.user;
                    this.errorMessage = '';
                })
                .catch(error => {
                    this.errorMessage = error.message;
                    console.error("Google sign-in error:", error);
                });
        }
    },
};
</script>

<style scoped>
.error {
    color: red;
    font-size: 0.9em;
}
</style>
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conditional Rendering:} The template uses Vue.js directives (\texttt{v-if} and \texttt{v-else}) to conditionally display content based on whether a user is authenticated. A personalized welcome message is shown when the user is signed in, while a sign-in form is presented otherwise.
    \item \textbf{Data Binding and State Management:} The component’s data properties (\texttt{email}, \texttt{password}, \texttt{user}, and \texttt{errorMessage}) are used to manage form inputs, the authenticated user state, and error messages.
    \item \textbf{Sign-In Method:} The \texttt{signIn} method invokes Firebase Authentication’s \texttt{signInWithEmailAndPassword} function. Proper error handling is implemented to provide feedback to the user in case of sign-in failures.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Authentication Updates:} The \texttt{onAuthStateChanged} listener, set up in the \texttt{created} hook, ensures that the component’s state is kept in sync with the authentication status, thereby reflecting any changes immediately in the UI.
    \item \textbf{Google Sign-In:} The \texttt{signInWithGoogle} method demonstrates how to enable Google sign-in using Firebase’s GoogleAuthProvider. This method follows a similar pattern to the email/password sign-in process.
    \item \textbf{Styling and Error Handling:} The component includes scoped styles for error messages and provides visual feedback to users when authentication errors occur.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Best Practices and Future Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error Handling and User Feedback:} Robust error handling is essential for providing clear user feedback and maintaining a secure application environment.
    \item \textbf{Scalability and Maintainability:} Modularizing the Firebase configuration and authentication logic allows for easier maintenance and future feature integrations, such as multi-factor authentication.
    \item \textbf{Security Enhancements:} Implementing advanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and periodic token refresh, can further enhance the platform’s security posture.
\end{itemize}

Through these implementations, the Intelligent Student AI Hub not only provides secure authentication and personalized user experiences but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements in user engagement and data security.

\subsection{TSN Integration}

Every student at HTL is provided with a TSN email account, which serves as the primary communication channel within the institution. During the development of the Student AI Hub, integrating the TSN email account was considered as a potential feature. However, after careful evaluation, we decided against this integration for several critical reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security Concerns:} Incorporating the TSN email account would necessitate accessing sensitive user data. Without robust safeguards, this could significantly increase the risk of security breaches and data leakage.
    \item \textbf{Technical Complexity:} The integration would require the implementation of more sophisticated authentication mechanisms than those offered by Firebase. This added complexity could result in compatibility issues and pose significant challenges in terms of ongoing maintenance and support.
    \item \textbf{Impact on User Experience:} Requiring users to navigate additional authentication steps to access the platform could negatively affect the overall user experience. A more complicated login process may lead to reduced adoption rates and lower user satisfaction.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory and Compliance Challenges:} Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and institutional policies would be more demanding with the TSN email integration. This approach would require addressing additional legal and technical considerations to maintain adherence to relevant standards.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interactive Chatbot for Day-to-Day AI Questions}

The objective of this feature is to provide students with immediate, context-aware responses to a broad spectrum of AI-related inquiries. To achieve this, the Intelligent Student AI Hub integrates multiple advanced Ollama AI models (e.g., LLaMA 3.2 and Mistral), enabling users to select the model that best fits the complexity and responsiveness required by their query. This modular approach ensures that students receive the most effective and contextually relevant answers, thereby enhancing their learning experience.

A self-hosted Flask API serves as the intermediary between the user interface and the Ollama API. This architecture allows the system to capture user input, forward the request to the selected AI model via the Flask API, and then relay the model's response back to the user in real time. The following abbreviated code listing illustrates the core implementation within a Vue.js component, demonstrating how the integration is achieved:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=html, caption={Abbreviated Vue.js Integration Example}, frame=single]
// Template section: model selection, chat display, and user input
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- AI Model Selection -->
    <select v-model="selectedModel">
      <option value="llama3.2:1b">LLaMA 3.2 - 1B (Fast)</option>
      <option value="llama3.2">LLaMA 3.2 - 2B (Latest)</option>
      <!-- more Models -->
    </select>
    <!-- Chat Display -->
    <div v-for="msg in currentChat.messages" :key="msg.id">
      <p v-if="msg.type==='user'">{{ msg.text }}</p>
      <p v-else>{{ msg.text }}</p>
    </div>
    <!-- User Input and Submission -->
    <input v-model="userInput" @keydown.enter="sendMessage" placeholder="Ask the AI question..." />
    <button @click="sendMessage">Send</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import axios from 'axios';
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      userInput: '',
      selectedModel: 'llama3.2:1b',
      currentChat: { messages: [] },
    };
  },
  methods: {
    async sendMessage() {
      if (!this.userInput.trim()) return;
      // Append user message to chat
      this.currentChat.messages.push({ id: Date.now(), type: 'user', text: this.userInput });
      // Send the query to the Flask API
      const response = await axios.post('http://server-address/ask_ollama', {
        prompt: this.userInput,
        model: this.selectedModel,
      });
      // Append AI response to chat
      this.currentChat.messages.push({ id: Date.now(), type: 'ollama', text: response.data.choices[0].text });
      this.userInput = '';
    },
  },
};
</script>
\end{lstlisting}

This example demonstrates the fundamental components of the integration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Model Selection:} A dropdown menu allows users to choose from various AI models, balancing speed and sophistication.
  \item \textbf{Real-Time Communication:} User inputs are captured and transmitted asynchronously to the Flask API, which then retrieves responses from the selected Ollama AI model.
  \item \textbf{Dynamic Chat Interface:} The chat interface updates dynamically with both user queries and AI responses, ensuring an engaging, real-time interaction.
\end{itemize}

By decoupling the frontend from the backend AI processing via a RESTful API, this design not only simplifies maintenance but also facilitates future scalability. New models or enhanced features can be integrated with minimal changes to the existing codebase, ensuring the platform remains adaptable to evolving educational needs.

% ****************************************************

\section{OpenAI Integration}

Given that locally hosted Ollama AI models may not achieve the same performance level as commercially available state-of-the-art solutions, 
the Intelligent Student AI Hub integrates advanced OpenAI models—such as ChatGPT and DALL-E—to deliver superior capabilities in text generation and image synthesis. 
This integration not only augments the quality of responses but also significantly enhances platform scalability. With the OpenAI API, 
scalability is effectively decoupled from hardware limitations, unlike the self-hosted Ollama API, which is inherently constrained by the available computational 
resources.

\subsection{ChatGPT API and Its Limitations}

A primary limitation of the ChatGPT API is the cost associated with each API request. 
Every query incurs a fee that can rapidly accumulate with high usage volumes. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ChatGPT-API_Pricing.png}
    \caption{ChatGP API Pricing}
    \label{fig:chatgpt_api_integration}
\end{figure}

\cite{ChatGPT-API-Pricing}

For instance, utilizing ChatGPT-4o Mini costs \$0.30 per million input tokens, 
whereas the full ChatGPT-4o model incurs a cost of \$3.75 per million input tokens equating to a 12.5-fold increase in expense 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:chatgpt_api_integration}).
\footnote{Pricing data is current as of 17.02.2025 and may be subject to change.} 

Consequently, the development team has opted to restrict the use of the ChatGPT API. 
This measured approach enables students to benefit from ChatGPT’s advanced functionalities while effectively managing costs. 
Moreover, it is more economical for the institution to subsidize access to the API than to provide every student with an individual premium account.

\subsection{User Access to Paid Services}

Standard users are allocated a finite number of ChatGPT API requests per month, with these request tokens being replenished on a monthly basis. The number of tokens consumed per query is contingent upon the chosen model.
\footnote{Token allocations and model thresholds are periodically adjusted in response to current pricing structures and monthly usage limits.} 
Should a user exhaust their monthly token quota, they may alternatively direct their queries to the Ollama API. In addition to standard user access, premium, teacher, and administrator accounts are available, each benefiting from a higher monthly token allocation. Initially, all users are granted standard access; any desired upgrade to premium, teacher, or administrator status requires a formal request to the platform administration.

\subsection{Integration of OpenAI's API}

For a comprehensive guide on integrating OpenAI's API into a Vue.js project, please refer to Chapter \ref{chap:Introduction_to_the_used_Large_Language_Models}, Section \ref{subsec:Code Example: Vue.js Component for OpenAI API Integration}.
