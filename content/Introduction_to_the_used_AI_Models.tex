%********************************************************************************

\section{Evaluation of Models via the Ollama Platform}

In this project, we conducted an evaluation of various models accessible through the Ollama application, which are available for download from the Ollama server.

Given that Ollama operates locally, it was imperative to select models that align with specific criteria to ensure optimal performance. 
Consequently, we assessed models of diverse sizes and complexities to determine their suitability for local deployment. 
This evaluation encompassed both the efficacy and efficiency of the models within a local environment.

\cite{Ollama-Download-Website}

\subsection{Model Selection Criteria}

The selection of models was guided by the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model Size:} The model must be capable of running on the server without exceeding available memory capacity.
\item \textbf{Performance Speed:} The response time of the model, i.e., how quickly it can generate output.
\item \textbf{Complexity:} The model's ability to handle complex prompts and generate coherent, contextually accurate text.
\item \textbf{Accuracy:} The overall precision of the model's responses, particularly in terms of factual correctness and linguistic quality.
\item \textbf{Language Support:} The model's proficiency in understanding and generating text in multiple languages, particularly English and German.
\item \textbf{User Experience:} The model's overall usability and user-friendliness, including ease of integration and customization.
\end{itemize}

There is often a trade-off between these criteria. 
Larger models tend to exhibit higher accuracy and greater contextual understanding but are generally slower and 
require more computational resources.

\subsection{Challenges in Model Testing and Updates}

One significant challenge lies in the rapid development and frequent release of new models, 
which complicates the process of continuous integration and comprehensive evaluation of recent advancements. 
Regular testing and updates are imperative to ensure the incorporation of state-of-the-art models while maintaining system reliability and relevance.

Another challenge involves achieving an optimal balance between performance, accuracy, and resource efficiency, 
ensuring that the chosen model meets the application’s functional requirements without compromising the overall user experience.

During the evaluation process, we encountered several obstacles. For instance, 
identifying standardized questions that could be uniformly answered by all models proved challenging. 
Some smaller models demonstrated limitations in addressing certain questions comprehensively. Additionally, 
specialized models, while excelling in niche areas, often lacked the ability to provide detailed answers across a broader range of topics.

\subsection{Data Collection}

For the Data collection we used the School AI Server wich was provided by the HTL Anichstraße, to run the different models in the Evaluation phase.
For the later Data collection we used our own Server to run the different models.


To colletct the data we used a varaitey of different python scripts. For the quantitative data we used the following python script:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Python, caption={Python-quantitative-data-collection}, captionpos=b]
import time
import json
import psutil  # For CPU, memory usage
from ollama import chat

# Prompts for testing
prompts = [
    "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms.",
    "Create a short story about a knight.",
    "What are the advantages of open-source projects?",
    "Write a Python function that outputs prime numbers up to 100.",
    # ...
]

# Model name
model_name = "qwen2-math"

# Store results
results = []

# Function to get GPU usage if available
def get_gpu_usage():
    try:
        import torch
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            gpu_memory = torch.cuda.memory_allocated() / (1024 ** 2)  # Convert to MB
            gpu_utilization = torch.cuda.utilization(0) if hasattr(torch.cuda, 'utilization') else "N/A"
            return gpu_memory, gpu_utilization
        else:
            return 0, "No GPU detected"
    except ImportError:
        return 0, "torch not installed"

# Loop through prompts
for prompt in prompts:
    try:
        # Measure system usage before model execution
        cpu_before = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)
        memory_before = psutil.virtual_memory().used / (1024 ** 2)  # Convert to MB

        start_time = time.time()
        # Ollama chat request
        response = chat(model=model_name, messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}])
        end_time = time.time()

        latency = end_time - start_time

        # Measure system usage after model execution
        cpu_after = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)
        memory_after = psutil.virtual_memory().used / (1024 ** 2)  # Convert to MB

        cpu_usage = cpu_after - cpu_before
        memory_usage = memory_after - memory_before
        gpu_memory_usage, gpu_utilization = get_gpu_usage()

        # Extract content from the Message object
        if response and hasattr(response["message"], "content"):
            response_text = response["message"].content  # Accessing the attribute of the Message object
        else:
            response_text = "No content returned or unexpected format"

        print(f"Prompt: {prompt}\nResponse Time: {latency:.2f} seconds\n")

        # Save the result
        results.append({
            "Prompt": prompt,
            "Response Time (seconds)": latency,
            "Response": response_text,
            "CPU Usage (%)": cpu_usage,
            "Memory Usage (MB)": memory_usage,
            "GPU Memory Usage (MB)": gpu_memory_usage,
            "GPU Utilization (%)": gpu_utilization
        })
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error with prompt '{prompt}': {e}")
        results.append({
            "Prompt": prompt,
            "Response Time (seconds)": "Error",
            "Response": f"Error: {str(e)}",
            "CPU Usage (%)": "N/A",
            "Memory Usage (MB)": "N/A",
            "GPU Memory Usage (MB)": "N/A",
            "GPU Utilization (%)": "N/A"
        })20.01.2025

# Save to JSON file
json_file_name = model_name + "_response_time_results_ressours_usage.json"
with open(json_file_name, "w") as file:
    json.dump(results, file, indent=4)

print(f"The results have been saved in {json_file_name}.")

\end{lstlisting}


For this Pyhton Skript we used ChatGPT to help with the psutil library to get the CPU and Memory usage. 
We also used ChatGPT to get more Questions for the data collection. 

The results were saved as JSON files for the later analysis. One Problem we encountered were the tourch librarys, witch 
diden't function probally on the School AI Server, so we couldn't get the GPU usage for the models.

%********************************************************************************

\section{Integration of OpenAI's API}

In this work, we integrated the OpenAI API to leverage proprietary, 
high-performance AI models that are hosted on dedicated servers with advanced hardware capabilities. 
The utilization of external computing power allows for the concurrent execution of multiple models, 
thereby enhancing both scalability and efficiency in our application.

The decision to adopt the OpenAI API was influenced by its widespread adoption, 
robust performance, and extensive documentation. Numerous examples, tutorials, and community resources are available, 
which greatly facilitate the integration process and ensure that best practices are followed in scientific and industrial applications.

\subsection{Overview of the OpenAI API}

The OpenAI API provides access to state-of-the-art AI models developed by OpenAI, including various iterations of the ChatGPT model. 
These models are capable of generating human-like text, answering queries, and engaging in complex conversations. 
The API supports a range of models with different sizes and capabilities, allowing users to select the model that best fits 
the requirements of their specific use cases.

Designed with user accessibility in mind, the API comes with comprehensive documentation and a wealth of code samples, 
which significantly streamline the process of embedding advanced AI functionalities into diverse applications and platforms. 
Furthermore, the API utilizes a token-based pricing model, which charges users according to the number of tokens processed during interactions. 
This pricing structure is not only transparent but also aligns closely with the computational effort required to generate responses.

Before accessing the API's full functionality, users must pre-fund their accounts by depositing a specified amount of money. 
This account-based billing system enables users to manage their expenditures effectively, including the option to set monthly spending limits. 
In addition to text generation, the OpenAI ecosystem also includes DAL-E, an image-generation model that creates visuals based on textual input, 
thus broadening the spectrum of applications available through the API.

\cite{OpenAI-API-Documentation}

\subsubsection{Tokens in Large Language Models}

Tokens are the fundamental units of text that large language models (LLMs) process and generate. 
In this context, a token represents the smallest segment of text that a model can understand, which may correspond to an entire word, 
a fragment of a word, or even an individual character or punctuation mark. 

The process of tokenization involves converting raw text into these discrete units. 
This approach enables LLMs to efficiently capture complex patterns in both syntax and semantics, even when encountering new or out-of-vocabulary terms. 
Techniques such as subword tokenization are particularly valuable, as they break down words into meaningful components, 
thereby reducing the overall vocabulary size and enhancing the model's ability to manage linguistic variability.

Moreover, tokens are closely related to the concept of a context window, which defines the span of tokens a model can consider during text generation or prediction. 
Typically, one token is estimated to average around four characters in English or roughly three-quarters of a word. 
This estimation is crucial for determining computational requirements and understanding the limitations imposed by the model’s finite context window.

In summary, tokens are indispensable for the operation of LLMs, providing a structured means to process language. 
Their effective management through advanced tokenization strategies is essential for optimizing both the computational efficiency and the overall performance 
of these models.

\cite{understanding-tokens-context-window-llms}


\subsection{Data Security and Privacy in Compliance with Austrian and EU Regulations}

The integration of OpenAI's API into our systems necessitates a thorough examination of data security and privacy considerations, 
particularly in the context of Austrian and European Union (EU) regulations. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the cornerstone of data protection within the EU, imposing stringent requirements on the 
processing of personal data.

OpenAI has implemented several measures to safeguard user data and align with GDPR mandates. 
Notably, they support compliance with privacy laws such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), 
offering a Data Processing Addendum to customers. Their API and related products have undergone evaluation by an independent third-party auditor, 
confirming alignment with industry standards for security and confidentiality. 

\cite{OpenAI-Data-Residency-Europe}

Despite these measures, concerns have been raised regarding data handling practices. 
For instance, data transmitted through the OpenAI API could potentially be exposed, and compliance with GDPR remains a complex issue. Additionally, 
data may be accessible to third-party subprocessors, introducing further privacy considerations.

\cite{OpenAI-privacy-complaint-Austria}

To address these concerns, we have proactively informed our user community through a notice on the school website. 
This notice outlines the data handling practices associated with the OpenAI API and provides guidance on how users can manage their data when 
interacting with our systems. By maintaining transparency and offering clear instructions, 
we aim to uphold the highest standards of data security and privacy in our academic environment.

In light of the evolving regulatory landscape, it is imperative to remain vigilant and responsive to any changes in data protection laws within 
Austria and the broader EU. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of our data handling practices will ensure ongoing compliance and the safeguarding of user privacy. 


\subsection{OpenAI API Implementation in Vue.js}

This section details the integration of the OpenAI API within a Vue.js application framework, with a focus on both text and image generation capabilities. The implementation not only illustrates the interaction between the Vue.js frontend and the OpenAI API but also demonstrates adherence to security best practices and modular code design. The following discussion is supported by annotated code examples and an explanation of the libraries used.

\subsubsection{Overview of the Implementation}

The implementation is structured as a Vue.js component that facilitates the following functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accepting user input via a text area.
    \item Initiating API calls for generating text responses (using ChatGPT models) and creating images (via the DALL-E endpoint).
    \item Displaying the results (generated text and images) dynamically within the user interface.
\end{itemize}

The component is designed with a clear separation between presentation and business logic, ensuring that the code remains both maintainable and scalable.

\subsubsection{Explanation of the Used Libraries}

\paragraph{OpenAI Library}  
The \texttt{openai} library is employed as the primary interface to interact with OpenAI’s API endpoints. This library abstracts the complexities of HTTP communication and provides a user-friendly API to access advanced AI functionalities such as natural language generation and image synthesis. Its integration simplifies the process of constructing API requests and handling responses, which is critical for developing robust AI-driven applications.

\paragraph{API Key Management}  
To ensure secure handling of sensitive credentials, the OpenAI API key is imported from an external module (i.e., \texttt{OPENAI\_API\_KEY} from the \texttt{secrets} file). This approach adheres to security best practices by preventing the direct embedding of API keys within the source code, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized exposure.

\subsubsection{Code Example: Vue.js Component for OpenAI API Integration}

Below is an illustrative example of a Vue.js component that integrates the OpenAI API for both text and image generation. The code is presented in two parts: the HTML template and the JavaScript logic.

\paragraph{HTML Template}

\subsubsection{Discussion}

The presented component exemplifies how modern web applications can seamlessly integrate AI capabilities while maintaining a secure and modular architecture. Key points of consideration include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modularity:} The separation of the UI (HTML template) and the business logic (JavaScript methods) facilitates easier maintenance and potential scalability.
    \item \textbf{Security:} By importing the API key from an external secrets module, the risk of credential leakage is minimized. This practice is crucial in academic and production environments where data security is paramount.
    \item \textbf{Extensibility:} The design allows for further expansion, such as additional error handling mechanisms or the integration of more advanced functionalities provided by the OpenAI API.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, this integration not only demonstrates the practical application of AI APIs in modern web development but also reflects best practices in secure and maintainable code design. Such an approach is essential for building reliable applications in both academic research and industrial contexts.
