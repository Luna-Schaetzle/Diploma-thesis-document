\cite{Open_Source_Initiative_OS_definition}

\subsection{Misconceptions About Open Source}

Open Source is often misunderstood and confused with other software distribution models, which can lead to misconceptions about its nature, functionality, and benefits. 
It is crucial to distinguish Open Source from other types of software:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Source:} Software that is freely accessible, modifiable, and redistributable under an Open Source license, adhering to principles such as transparency and collaboration.
    \item \textbf{Freeware:} Software available at no cost but typically without access to the source code, meaning users cannot modify or redistribute it.
    \item \textbf{Proprietary Software:} Software owned and controlled by a single entity, restricting access to the source code and preventing users from making modifications or redistributions.
    \item \textbf{Commercial Software:} Software sold for profit, which may be either Open Source or proprietary, depending on the licensing terms.
\end{itemize}

Understanding these distinctions helps users make informed choices about software selection and ensures their expectations align with the capabilities and freedoms provided by the chosen software.

To verify whether a software is truly Open Source, it is essential to examine the license agreement and confirm the availability of the source code. 
Software with an OSI-approved license is a reliable indicator that it adheres to Open Source principles, providing transparency, freedom, and collaboration opportunities.

One common misconception about Open Source software arises from the phrase "free as in freedom" versus "free as in free beer." While "free as in freedom" emphasizes the liberty to access, modify, and share the software, "free as in free beer" simply denotes that the software is free of cost. 
Although Open Source software is often available without charge, its true value lies in the freedom it grants to users, developers, and organizations. 
This distinction highlights the broader significance of Open Source as a philosophy, not just a pricing model.
