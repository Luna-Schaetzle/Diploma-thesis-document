\section{Initial Concept}

The initial concept for this Diploma Thesis was to explore various methodologies for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) across diverse application domains. The primary objective was to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the performance of AI models in a range of tasks and use cases. This framework was intended to include both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, facilitated in part by the use of structured questionnaires to capture user experiences and application-specific requirements. However, early analysis revealed that the scope of this concept was overly broad. The project team quickly recognized that the lack of a focused research question, as well as the ambiguous integration of the various components, would make it challenging to implement the project within the available time and resources.

\section{The Self-Sufficiency Raspberry-PI project}

In response to these challenges, the project team refined its approach by narrowing the scope to a more tangible and achievable idea—the Self-Sufficiency Project. This project was designed around the development of a self-contained system based on a Raspberry Pi, capable of autonomously executing a variety of tasks. The core idea was to demonstrate a practical application of AI by minimizing reliance on external APIs and services, thereby increasing system robustness and independence. Additionally, the design emphasized portability, with the entire system housed in a compact enclosure to facilitate deployment in diverse environments. Figure~\ref{fig:SelfSufficiencyProject} illustrates the conceptual framework of the Self-Sufficiency Raspberry Pi Project.

\section{Challenges and Limitations of the Self-Sufficiency Raspberry-PI Project}

During the development of the Self-Sufficiency Project, several significant challenges and limitations emerged that prompted a critical reassessment of the project’s direction. These challenges included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complexity of Implementation:} The integration of heterogeneous AI models with multiple hardware components introduced considerable technical difficulties, necessitating extensive iterative development and rigorous testing.
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints:} The self-sufficiency paradigm, while beneficial for system independence, inherently restricted scalability and interoperability with external systems, thereby limiting future expansion.
    \item \textbf{Resource Limitations:} The ambitious scope of the project, combined with constrained time and technical expertise, rendered the initial plan impractical.
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity in Objectives:} The absence of clearly defined, measurable goals complicated the assessment of progress and the determination of success criteria.
    \item \textbf{Integration Challenges:} The complexity of harmonizing various AI models, hardware interfaces, and supporting software systems proved to be more formidable than initially anticipated.
    \item \textbf{Time Constraints:} Preliminary evaluations indicated that the project’s timeline was insufficient to address the technical and logistical challenges identified.
\end{itemize}

In light of these challenges, the project team concluded that a more narrowly defined and feasible approach was necessary. Consequently, the focus shifted towards a new concept that emphasizes AI applications and their specific use cases.

\section{Transition to the Current Project Concept}

After reevaluating the limitations of the initial approaches, the project team restructured the initiative into a more focused framework, subdividing it into three distinct components. This revised approach not only addresses the previously identified constraints but also aligns more closely with the overarching research objectives. The current project concept is organized into the following three components:

\subsection{AI for Education}

This component explores the integration of AI technologies within educational settings. The primary goal is to develop an AI-powered web application that facilitates interactive and personalized learning experiences, particularly for IT students. By leveraging adaptive learning algorithms, the system aims to enhance comprehension and engagement, thereby contributing to more effective educational practices.

\subsection{AI Integration in Software Development}

Focusing on the software development domain, this component investigates how AI can assist developers in writing and debugging code. The objective is to develop an AI model that integrates seamlessly into the development workflow, for example, via a Visual Studio Code extension. This extension is designed to provide real-time code analysis, suggestions, and bug detection, ultimately improving code quality and development efficiency.
