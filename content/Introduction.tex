\chapter{Introduction: AI in the Industry and Education Environment}
\label{chap:introduction}

% write something about the current Rise of AI and the difficulties of the implementation in the industry and education environment
% Then split the students and thier main field of study in the Diploma thesis


% Maby write something about the whay we made the documentations

%This chapter explains the rationale behind choosing the topic. It outlines the objectives and scope of the overall project, as well as the technical and economic context in which it is situated.

In the context of the ongoing digital transformation, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in various industries.
AI technologies are used to automate processes, optimize production, and improve quality. 
In the education sector, AI is used to support learning processes, personalize learning content, and provide feedback to students. 
However, the implementation of AI in the industry and education environment is still a challenge due to the complexity of the technologies involved, 
the lack of expertise, and the high costs associated with the development and deployment of AI solutions.

\section{The use of artificial intelligence in this Diploma Thesis}

To create and write this diploma thesis, we used artificial intelligence to support the writing process.
The AI was used to generate text, analyze data, and provide feedback on the content.
The AI tools used in this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ChatGPT
    \item Github Copilot
    \item Deepseek
    \item Ollama
    \item Claude 
\end{itemize}
