\section{Ethical and Legal Implications of AI in Economics}
\label{sec:ethical-and-legal-implications-of-ai-in-economics}

Descripe the ethical and legal implications of AI in economics. 


\subsection{Training Data Issues}

\subsection{Privacy Concerns}

\subsection{Regulatory Challenges}

The increasing deployment of artificial intelligence in various economic sectors has introduced a wide range of regulatory challenges, particularly regarding data security, privacy, and compliance with both established legal frameworks and emerging regulatory measures. A landmark initiative addressing these concerns is the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 \cite{EU-AI-Act-text}), which represents the first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence on a global scale. This Act is designed to harmonize AI regulations across EU member states by adopting a risk-based approach that categorizes AI systems according to their potential impact on fundamental rights and public safety.

Under the EU AI Act, AI systems are classified into several risk tiers—from minimal to high risk—with the most critical applications subject to stringent requirements, including mandatory conformity assessments, robust data governance practices, and enforced human oversight. These measures aim to enhance transparency, accountability, and public trust in AI technologies. Moreover, the framework promotes continuous post-market monitoring and adaptive regulatory responses to keep pace with rapid technological advancements.

By establishing clear guidelines for AI deployment, the framework seeks to balance the dual objectives of fostering innovation while safeguarding societal values. This comprehensive approach not only addresses the complex legal and ethical issues inherent in AI but also sets a precedent for future regulatory initiatives at the international level \cite{EURegFrameworkAI}.

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:Outlook} and Section~\ref{ref:challanges-and-opportunities}, numerous experts advocate for the implementation of more extensive global regulations to effectively mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence.

\subsection{Data Security}

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:Introduction_to_the_used_large_language_Models}, particularly in Section~\ref{sec:data-security-privacy-openai} on Data Security and Privacy in Compliance with Austrian and EU Regulations, several regulatory challenges affect the data security and privacy of AI models.

A key issue is that user data is frequently stored on cloud servers, which increases the risk of security breaches and data leaks. Moreover, many leading AI companies are headquartered outside the European Union, potentially complicating compliance with EU and Austrian data protection laws.
