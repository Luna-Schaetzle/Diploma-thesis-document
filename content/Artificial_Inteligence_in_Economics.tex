\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this chapter, the transformative role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within economic systems and its broad impact on various sectors has been examined. The potential benefits and challenges of integrating AI into economic processes are being assesed, considering the implications for businesses, consumers, and policymakers. Additionally, current AI applications in economics and highlight emerging trends that are poised to shape the future of the field are reviewed.

\section{The Role of AI in Economics}
\label{sec:role-of-ai-in-economics}

Artificial Intelligence has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of economics by introducing advanced analytical tools and automation capabilities. AI-driven solutions are employed to optimize production processes, enhance supply chain management, and improve customer service operations. By processing large volumes of data, AI can identify complex patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed, thereby supporting more informed decision-making. Moreover, the automation of repetitive tasks allows employees to focus on strategic and creative activities, further driving innovation and efficiency within organizations.

\section{Risks of AI}
\label{sec:risks-of-ai}

While the various benefits of AI seem promising, there are also risks associated with its implementation in economics.
It is essential for businesses and policymakers to address these risks and develop strategies to mitigate them effectively.

\cite{AiEconomics}

\subsection{Job displacement}
\label{subsec:job-displacement}

One of the main concerns is the potential for job displacement, as AI technologies have the potential to automate many tasks that are currently performed by humans. This could lead to widespread unemployment and economic instability if not managed properly. 

Since the benefits of AI are vast, there will be a change in the labor market comparable to the industrial revolution.  
But in the changing market there also will be openings for new jobs that need to be done. 

\cite{AiAndJobs} 

\subsection{Bias in algorithms and data}
\label{subsec:bias-in-algorithms-and-data}

But there also is a risk of bias. Since for many AI models it is unclear how they have been trained. 
Poorly trained AI models can lead to potentially devastating errors that negatively affect the company.

One of the main reasons for bias is a flawed dataset. If the training data is missing some crucial data, the results can become very unpleasing. 
Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the training data for potential biases.

Another factor is a poorly develpoed algorithm. A bad algorithm can amplify the data bias, and create new biases on accident. 

When going to the root of the problem, it often is a cognitve bias that the model inherits from its creators. 
These biases can be implemented intentional and unintentional. Since all humans have some kind of bias it is nearly impossible to eliminate them. 

Mitigation AI bias can be a very resource heavy task. After identifying a bias, the model needs to be retrained. This can cost a lot of both money and time. 

\cite{AiDataBias}

\subsection{Transparency}
\label{subsec:transparence}

Some of the biggest tech companies that offer AI services tend to be very non-transparent with their data. 
The latest example of this is the Deepseek r1 model developed by a chinese startup. But other players like OpenAi's ChatGPT also have similar issues.

Due to the non-transparent handling of private information, many concerns arise. Most private users and companys do not want their data to be on unknown servers.

Additionally it is hard to identify the source of biases these models may have. Since both algorithm and training data are not public knowledge, it becomes nearly impossible to mitigate them.

\cite{larsson2020transparency}

\subsection{Training data and ethical concerns}
\label{subsec:training-data-and-ethical-concerns}

Training data forms the foundation of AI systems, fundamentally influencing their performance, biases, and decision-making processes. However, the methods employed in assembling and curating these datasets have sparked significant ethical debates, primarily due to concerns surrounding copyrighted material, transparency, and data privacy.

A primary ethical issue is the incorporation of copyrighted content into training datasets. Many AI models are trained on vast amounts of internet-sourced data, much of which is subject to copyright restrictions. The unauthorized use of such material not only raises legal questions regarding intellectual property rights and fair use but also challenges the ethical legitimacy of reproducing or generating content that may infringe on these rights. This dilemma underscores the need for clear guidelines and licensing frameworks that respect the rights of original content creators.

Equally concerning is the lack of transparency in the disclosure of training data sources. Many state-of-the-art models do not provide comprehensive information about the origin, composition, or curation process of the data they use. This opacity hampers independent verification of data quality and bias, making it difficult for researchers, regulators, and the public to evaluate the fairness, representativeness, and potential ethical implications of the underlying datasets. In the absence of detailed documentation—such as datasheets for datasets—the risks associated with hidden biases and privacy violations remain unaddressed.

Furthermore, the aggregation of large datasets often includes personal information that may have been collected without explicit consent. The use of such data can lead to privacy breaches and raises questions about the ethical treatment of individuals whose information is repurposed for AI training. This issue not only compromises personal privacy but also potentially exposes organizations to legal repercussions under data protection regulations.

In conclusion, while extensive training data is essential for developing robust AI systems, the ethical concerns regarding copyrighted material, lack of transparency, and privacy breaches highlight the urgent need for standardized ethical guidelines and regulatory oversight. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure that the development and deployment of AI technologies are both legally compliant and ethically responsible.
