# AI Integration in Education and Software Development

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my diploma thesis, which explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational and software development environments.

## Abstract

This diploma thesis examines the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational and software development environments. Recognizing the increasing role of AI in automating processes, optimizing operations, and enhancing quality, as well as supporting personalized learning, the thesis addresses challenges such as complexity, limited expertise, and high development costs.

The primary goal was to develop AI-driven solutions for both fields. This involved setting up a server (API) to host AI models, developing a backend for an AI Hub and a Visual Studio Code Extension, and integrating suitable AI models. The work documents a shift from a broad evaluation of AI models to practical, focused applications.

A key aspect of the thesis is the implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Various free and commercial LLMs were evaluated using the Ollama application for local deployment and the OpenAI API, with quantitative and qualitative methods assessing response time, resource utilization, and text quality. This led to the selection and integration of specific models.

Additionally, a self-hosted Flask service was developed to link the frontend and backend components for both the Intelligent Student AI Hub and the Visual Studio Code Extension. The thesis also outlines the architecture of a web platform featuring an interactive chatbot, image-to-text tool, programming bot, and user account management, and includes economic evaluations of AI and open-source technologies.

## Key Findings

The key findings highlight the transformative potential of AI in education and industry. Although some planned features were omitted due to time constraints, the modular architecture supports future enhancements.
